## Algorithms and Data Structures University Project

* C++ source files with HeapSort and InsertionSort implementation and timing evaluation for random populated array of different sizes, with saving on a csv file.
* Python Script to plot HeapSort and InsertionSort comparison from csv. Generates average function between corresponding data in csv
* Bash script to automatize the test for multiple repetitions of same execution and automatic call to python script

Usage:
> ./launchTest.sh

or directly
> ./TesinaAlgoritmi [repetition index] [iterations number for different size] [max value for random generated array] [filename prefix]
